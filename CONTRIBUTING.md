# Contributing to THP-Contracts

Thank you for contributing! Please note:

1. Contributions must follow the utility-only and governance-only structure.
2. NFTs must remain utility-only; no monetary rewards, dividends, or profit.
3. DAO contracts must remain non-financial; only governance voting is allowed.
4. Folder structure (contracts/NFTs, contracts/DAO, contracts/utils, scripts, tests) must be respected.
5. All new code should include tests.
6. Open an issue before large changes.
