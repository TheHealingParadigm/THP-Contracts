## 🔒 Legal & Compliance Notes (Important)

THP is intentionally designed to avoid triggering U.S. securities classifications (Howey Test).  
To maintain compliance:

### **NFTs (Utility Only)**
- THP NFTs provide **utility and access** only.  
- They may offer:  
  - Access to community spaces  
  - Roles, identity badges, or early access  
  - Extra DAO voting weight (governance only)  
- **They do NOT provide:**  
  - Profit share  
  - Dividends  
  - Monetary rewards  
  - Token payouts  
  - Investment promises of any kind  

THP NFTs are **not investments** and should never be sold or represented as such.

---

### **DAO Governance (Non-Financial)**
- The THP governance token exists **only for voting inside the DAO**.  
- It has **no profit rights** and **no financial expectations**.  
- Token holders may:  
  - Create proposals  
  - Vote on community decisions  
  - Participate in governance  

They may NOT expect:  
- Profit  
- Dividends  
- Price appreciation  
- Revenue share  

This structure is intentionally designed to avoid Howey criteria.

---

### ⚠️ No “Financial Logic” Allowed in This Repo
This repo must NOT contain smart contract code that:
- Automates token rewards for NFT buyers  
- Distributes revenue or yields  
- Issues tokens tied to profit  
- Creates investment-style mechanisms  
- Suggests monetary expectation or price gain  

Contributors must keep the code utility-focused and governance-only.
